            <h2>SWEET NOTES FROM YOUR SWEETEST BESTFRIEND</h2>
            <p>I think you've been 27 for so long, it's become your spirit age! But seriously, how do you keep it so consistent?"! </p>
            <p>"You're my favorite human to share laughs and food with"</p>
            <p>"Just as ghee brings out the best in coffee, you bring out the best in me!"</p>
            <p>"You're like a coffee in the morning‚Äîwithout you, I'd be a mess!</p>
            <p>you're the walnut to my ice cream‚Äîlife wouldn't be as nutty or delicious without you!</p>
            <p>"Just like Oppenheimer unlocked the secrets of the universe, you unlock the best in me. You're the catalyst that makes my life more meaningful and beautiful."</p>
            <p>Just like stumbling upon that amazing food stall by chance, I feel like I randomly found the best Raccoon. Both are unexpected treasures that make life so much more delicious!</p>
            <p>Just like Netflix series, 'OA', which we started watching together but never finished, our friendship is a story that's still unfolding‚Äîand I'm so excited to see what the next episodes bring</p>
            <p>Just like a cream roll, you are a perfect blend of layers‚Äîcrunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. You're the creamy filling that makes my life richer</p>
            <p>"You're like each special ingredient in a cheesecake recipe‚Äîunique, essential.</p>
            <p>"Just like Santiago discovered his treasure in the desert, It feels like the universe conspired to bring us together, and every moment with you reminds me that the simple things are the most extraordinary treasures of all(like sleeping all day)."</p>
            <p>"You've become like the alchemist's gold‚Äîtransformed from the ordinary to the extraordinary. Just as lead holds the potential to become gold, I'm so proud of the person you are‚Äîmy golden raccoon"</p>
            <p>"Every time I see you scrolling through your laptop, I feel like I'm binge-watching the best series ever!"</p>
            <p>"You're my personal journalist who uncovers the best stories</p>
            <p>"You're amazing on your own, but let's be honest‚Äîyou shine brightest when you are with me</p>
            <p>"I'm not sure what's more impressive‚Äîyour ability to fall asleep anywhere or your talent for making it look adorable. </p>
            <p>"Just as yellow is associated with optimism and joy, you bring positivity"</p>
            <p>"You‚Äôre like my personal Power BI dashboard‚Äîalways bringing clarity to my chaos and turning raw moments into beautiful insights"</p>
            <p>You‚Äôre like my favorite API‚Äîalways providing the perfect response to my requests, even when I don‚Äôt know exactly what I need. </p>
            <p>"You‚Äôre like the perfect piece of software‚Äîwell-designed, reliable, and always improving. Just like great software needs consistent updates to stay relevant, you keep surprising me with new and better versions of yourself. But let‚Äôs face it, you only work flawlessly when paired with me‚Äîyour ultimate compatible system"</p>
            <p>"You're my little 'trash panda'‚Äîalways finding treasures in unexpected places. Just as raccoons are resourceful and clever"</p>
            <p>"You‚Äôre like my personal OTG‚Äîcompact, versatile, and always making life better! Just like an OTG bakes, grills, and toasts to perfection, you bring warmth, flavor, and a little crispiness to my life. Without you, everything would feel half-baked!"</p>
            <p>"You‚Äôre like the Joy in my Headquarters‚Äîalways lighting up my world and reminding me to find happiness even in the little things. But just like Sadness taught Joy, you‚Äôve shown me that every emotion has its place, and together they make life beautiful. You‚Äôre the one who turns my core memories into treasures I‚Äôll cherish forever!"</p>
            <p>"You tried to make Maggi, and somehow it turned into soup! üòÇ But hey, even though it wasn‚Äôt exactly MasterChef material, it was made with love‚Äîand that‚Äôs what counts. Honestly, it wasn‚Äôt about the taste; it was about the effort. Next time, let‚Äôs stick to the classic 2-minute Maggi recipe, and I‚Äôll be your sous-chef!Until then, here‚Äôs a wish‚Äîmay all your future cooking adventures be as fun as that one and in that i should be included, but maybe a little tastier too! ü•∞"</p>
            <p>"Watching Bassi's show with you was like experiencing a rollercoaster of laughter‚Äîevery joke was a new twist that left us both giggling uncontrollably! cheers for more shows like that(with me)</p>
            <p>"Watching firecrackers with you on Diwali was like experiencing a kaleidoscope of colors and laughter‚Äîeach burst of light was a reminder of the joy you bring to my life!</p>
            <p>"You're like a Hazelnut White Chocolate Croissant‚Äîflaky, rich, and full of delightful surprises. Just as the combination of hazelnut and white chocolate creates a perfect harmony of flavors, you bring balance and sweetness"</p>
            <p>Wishing you a scoop of happiness and a night filled with laughter... and maybe some ice cream, remember that time we ate ice cream at midnight and thought we were invincible?</p>
            <p>Remember when we tried that awful avocado? It was like a bumpy road, but then we had chocolate, and everything was okay again. You're that chocolate</p>
            <p>You might have a collection of perfumes, but to me, you are the best fragrance.</p>
            <p>"Remember how we used to go back to that restaurant until they messed up our order? Well, I'll keep coming back to you until you stop being amazing, which is probably never!"</p>
            <p>"Remember how Mayfair always let us down until we found that incredible hazelnut pastry? You're like that pastry‚Äîunexpectedly amazing."</p>
            <p>"I'm not sure what's more impressive, your dance skills or you!"</p>
            <p>"Remember when we used to go bowling and I always lost? Well, I've realized that I've been winning all along because I get to spend time with you. You're the strike.</p>
            <p>"Remember that time I was drunk and drove you crazy? Just like 'Suno Na Suno Na,' even when I didn't make sense. Sorry for that, but thanks for putting up with me you are the best listener !"</p>
            <p>"Late-night diesel refill drives might not be the most exciting thing, but with you, even the simplest moments become special."</p>
            <p>Okay, Alright, I've been sweet enough but I guess I've sent you 36 notes‚Äîis that your age now, or just the number of times I've realized how awesome you are?"</p>
